# Cloudflare Zone Updater GUI
Mass update cloudflare domains/zones with your current IP address. 
As I host a lot of websites at home, Cloudflare Proxy is a great way to 
make sure my home IP address isn't exposed. But when my ISP rotates my IP, 
it means I have to update hundreds of Zone entries. This GUI tool is 
something I whipped together to update them all quickly in a user-friendly 
way. This is my first try at a desktop Grephical User Interface so buyer 
beware and all that. 


# ToDo:
- [ ] Add support for adding API key/token to keyring, env or config file.
- [ ] Auto refresh domains list after update.
- [ ] Add about section and licence.
- [ ] Make executable.
- [ ] Add support for enabling a service.
